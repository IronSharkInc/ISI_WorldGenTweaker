# ISI World Gen Tweaker

A 7 Days to Die (7D2D) mod that adjusts the parameters used in world generation.

- cities can spawn in any biome
- bigger cities
- more cities
- larger downtown areas
- more book POIs
- each district now has a unique color (previously six districts shared three colors)
- added road to Old West towns (a trader might spawn there too)

## Testing

**Important**: This mod is incompatible with ISI_Flat. Test them separately to avoid conflicts.

1. Generate a new world and verify cities spawn in multiple biomes
2. Check that cities are larger and more numerous than vanilla
3. Confirm downtown areas are expanded
4. Look for increased book POIs in cities
5. Verify Old West towns have road connections
